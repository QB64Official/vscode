### This is QB64's built-in help system. It's data is based on the QB64 Wiki. In fact, the pages shown here are cached copies of the online Wiki pages and are displayed here in a simplified form. Obviously we can't reproduce the detailed output of a full fledged web browser here, especially tables are too complex to handle it here. However, you can click the cyan colored View on Wiki button at any time to open the original online Wiki page in your standard browser.
