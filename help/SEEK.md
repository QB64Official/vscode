# SEEK

The **SEEK** statement sets the byte or record position in a file for the next read or write.

  

## Syntax

SEEK *filenumber&*, *position*
  

## Parameters

* *filenumber&* must be the file number that is [OPEN](OPEN.md) and being read or written to.
* *position* is a byte in [BINARY](BINARY.md) or sequencial files created in [OUTPUT](OUTPUT.md), [APPEND](APPEND.md) or [INPUT](INPUT.md) "INPUT (file mode)") modes. The first byte = 1.
* *position* is the record in [RANDOM](RANDOM.md) files to read or write. Records can hold more than one variable defined in a [TYPE](TYPE.md).
* Since the first **SEEK** file position is 1 it may require adding one to an offset value when documentation uses that position as 0.
* After a **SEEK** statement, the next file operation starts at that **SEEK** byte position.
* The **SEEK** statement can work with the [SEEK (function)](SEEK (function).md) "SEEK (function)") to move around in a file.

### Notes

* Don't confuse the [LOC](LOC.md) position with the [SEEK](SEEK.md) "SEEK (function)") positionÂ !!
	+ **LOC** is the last read or written byte or record prosition.
	+ **SEEK** is the byte or record prosition to read or write next.

  

## Examples

Example 1
A **SEEK** statement using the [SEEK (function)](SEEK (function).md) "SEEK (function)") to move to the next random record in a file.

``` SEEK 1, [SEEK](SEEK.md) "SEEK (function)")(1) + 1  
```

---

Example 2
Demonstrate the difference between **LOC** and **SEEK** positions in a file.

``` OPEN "readme.md" FOR BINARY AS #1  PRINT LOC(1) 'LOC returns 0, as we didn't read something yet PRINT SEEK(1) 'SEEK otherwise returns 1, as it's the first byte to read  GET #1, , a& 'now let's read a LONG (4 bytes)  PRINT LOC(1) 'now LOC returns 4, the last read byte PRINT SEEK(1) 'and SEEK returns 5 now, the next byte to read  CLOSE #1 END  
```

``` 0 1 4 5  
```
