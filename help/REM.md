## REM
---

### REM or an apostrophe is used for programmer remarks, comments or to stop the execution of program code.

#### SYNTAX

`REM program comment or ignore code`

#### DESCRIPTION
* Comments cannot be read by QBasic correctly and may cause syntax and other errors without [REM](./REM.md)!
* Instead of [REM](./REM.md) you can use the ' symbol which can be put anywhere.
* Code can also be commented out for program testing purposes.
* QBasic Metacommands such as $DYNAMIC and $INCLUDE require the use of [REM](./REM.md) or the apostrophe.
