#### DESCRIPTION

<blockquote>

* Use [EXIT](./EXIT.md) [CASE](./CASE.md) to immediately exit from a [CASE](./CASE.md) .
* In [SELECT](./SELECT.md) [EVERYCASE](./EVERYCASE.md) blocks execution will proceed with the next matching [CASE](./CASE.md) .
* In regular [SELECT](./SELECT.md) [CASE](./CASE.md) blocks execution will proceed after [END](./END.md) [SELECT](./SELECT.md) , i.e. [EXIT](./EXIT.md) [CASE](./CASE.md) and [EXIT](./EXIT.md) [SELECT](./SELECT.md) behave the same way here.
