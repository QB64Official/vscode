## [_SNDRAW](SNDRAW.md) [ðŸ“–](https://qb64phoenix.com/qb64wiki/index.php/_SNDRAW)
---
<blockquote>

### The _SNDRAW statement plays sound wave sample frequencies created by a program.

</blockquote>

#### SYNTAX

<blockquote>

`_SNDRAW leftSample [, rightSample ][, pipeHandle& ]`

</blockquote>

#### PARAMETERS

<blockquote>

*  The leftSample and rightSample value(s) can be any [SINGLE](SINGLE.md)  or [DOUBLE](DOUBLE.md)  literal or variable frequency value from -1.0 to 1.0.
*  The pipeHandle& parameter refers to the sound pipe opened using [_SNDOPENRAW](SNDOPENRAW.md)  .

</blockquote>

#### DESCRIPTION

<blockquote>

*  Specifying pipeHandle& allows sound to be played through two or more channels at the same time ( version 1.000 and up ).
*  If only leftSample value is used, the sound will come out of both speakers.
*  Using [_SNDRAW](SNDRAW.md)  will pause any currently playing music.
*  [_SNDRAW](SNDRAW.md)  is designed for continuous play. It will not produce any sound until a significant number of samples have been queued. No sound is played if only a few samples are queued.
*  Ensure that [_SNDRAWLEN](SNDRAWLEN.md)  is comfortably above 0 (until you've actually finished playing sound). If you are getting occasional unintended random clicks, this generally means that [_SNDRAWLEN](SNDRAWLEN.md)  has dropped to 0.
*  [_SNDRAW](SNDRAW.md)  is not intended to queue up many minutes worth of sound. It will probably work but will chew up a lot of memory (and if it gets swapped to disk, your sound could be interrupted abruptly).
*  [_SNDRATE](SNDRATE.md)  determines how many samples are played per second, but timing is done by the sound card, not your program.
*  Do not attempt to use _TIMER or [_DELAY](DELAY.md)  or [_LIMIT](LIMIT.md)  to control the timing of [_SNDRAW](SNDRAW.md) . You may use them for delays or to limit your program's CPU usage, but how much to queue should only be based on the [_SNDRAWLEN](SNDRAWLEN.md)  .
