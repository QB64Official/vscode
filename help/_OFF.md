# OFF

OFF is a flag that disables event-trappping for [KEY(n)](KEY(n).md) "KEY(n)"), [STRIG(n)](STRIG(n).md) "STRIG(n)") and [TIMER(n)](TIMER(n).md).

  

## Description

* OFF can be used to turn off the display of soft-key assignments at the bottom of the screen using [KEY](KEY.md).
* OFF can also be used to disable an event-trapping in the following statements: [KEY(n)](KEY(n).md) "KEY(n)"), [STRIG(n)](STRIG(n).md) "STRIG(n)") and [TIMER(n)](TIMER(n).md). The trap can be turned back [ON](ON.md), but all events triggered since OFF was used are lost.
* [$CHECKING]($CHECKING.md):**OFF** is used to disable C++ error trapping (used for verified sections of code that require speed).
