## SIN
---

### The SIN function returns the vertical component or sine of an angle measured in radians.

#### SYNTAX

`value! = SIN( radian_angle! )`

#### PARAMETERS
* The radian_angle must be measured in radians from 0 to 2 * Pi.


#### DESCRIPTION
* To convert from degrees to radians, multiply degrees * π/180.
* [SIN](./SIN.md) E is the vertical component of a unit vector in the direction theta (θ).
* Accuracy can be determined as [SINGLE](./SINGLE.md) by default or [DOUBLE](./DOUBLE.md) by following the parameter value with a # suffix.


#### SEE ALSO
* [_PI](./_PI.md)
* [COS](./COS.md)
* [ATN](./ATN.md)
* [TAN](./TAN.md)
* Mathematical Operations
* Derived Mathematical Functions
