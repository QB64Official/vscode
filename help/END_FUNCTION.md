## FUNCTION
---
<blockquote>

### A FUNCTION block statement is used to create a function procedure to return a calculated value to a program.

</blockquote>

#### SYNTAX

<blockquote>

`FUNCTION procedureName [type-suffix] [( parameters )] {code} 'variable definitions and procedure statements â‹® procedureName = returnValue`

</blockquote>

#### DESCRIPTION

<blockquote>

* The function type can be any variable type that it will return to the program and is represented by the type suffix.
* Functions hold one return value in the function's name which is a variable type. Other values can be passed through parameters .
* Functions are often referred to in program calculations, not called like [SUB](./SUB.md) procedures. [CALL](./CALL.md) cannot be used with functions.
* If there are no parameters passed or they are [SHARED](./SHARED.md) the parameters and parenthesis are not required.
* Variable names within the procedure do not have to match the names used in the reference parameters, just the value types.
* To pass parameter variables by value to protect the value in a call, parenthesis can be placed around each variable name also.
* To pass arrays to a sub-procedure use empty brackets after the name or indicate the index in the call.
* All dynamic variable values return to 0 or null strings when the procedure is exited except when a variable or the entire function is [STATIC](./STATIC.md) . This can save program memory as all dynamic memory used in a [FUNCTION](./FUNCTION.md) is released on procedure exit.
* [FUNCTION](./FUNCTION.md) procedure code can use [GOSUB](./GOSUB.md) and [GOTO](./GOTO.md) line numbers or labels inside of the procedure when necessary.
* For early function exits use [EXIT](./EXIT.md) [FUNCTION](./FUNCTION.md) before [END](./END.md) [FUNCTION](./FUNCTION.md) and [GOSUB](./GOSUB.md) procedures using [RETURN](./RETURN.md) .
* QB64 ignores all procedural [DECLARE](./DECLARE.md) statements. Define all parameter types in the [FUNCTION](./FUNCTION.md) procedure.
* Images are not deallocated when the [SUB](./SUB.md) or [FUNCTION](./FUNCTION.md) they are created in ends. Free them with [_FREEIMAGE](./_FREEIMAGE.md) .
* The IDE can create the [FUNCTION](./FUNCTION.md) and [END](./END.md) [FUNCTION](./FUNCTION.md) lines for you. Use the New [FUNCTION](./FUNCTION.md)... option in the Edit Menu. A box will come up for you to enter a name for the [FUNCTION](./FUNCTION.md). Enter all code between the [FUNCTION](./FUNCTION.md) and [END](./END.md) [FUNCTION](./FUNCTION.md) lines.
