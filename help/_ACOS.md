# _ACOS

The _ACOS function returns the angle measured in radians based on an input [COSine](COSine.md) value ranging from -1 to 1.

  

## Syntax

*radian_angle!* = _ACOS(*cosine_value!*)
  

## Description

* The *cosine_value!* must be measured >= -1 and <= 1, or an error will be generated. (PRINT _ACOS(1.2) would give the result of -1.#IND, which is basically QB64's way of telling us that the number doesn't exist, much like 1/0 would.)
* ARCCOSINE is the inverse function of [COSine](COSine.md), which lets us turn a [COSine](COSine.md) value back into an angle.
* Note: Due to rounding with floating point math, the _ACOS may not always give a perfect match for the COS angle which generated this. You can reduce the number of rounding errors by increasing the precision of your calculations by using [DOUBLE](DOUBLE.md) or [_FLOAT](_FLOAT.md) precision variables instead of [SINGLE](SINGLE.md).

  

## Availability

* **Version 1.000 and up.**

  

## Examples

*Example:* Converting a radian angle to its COSine and using that value to find the angle in degrees again using _ACOS:

``` [DEFDBL](DEFDBL.md) A-Z  [INPUT](INPUT.md) "Give me an Angle (in Degrees) => "; Angle [PRINT](PRINT.md) C = [COS](COS.md)([_D2R](_D2R.md)(Angle)) '_D2R is the command to convert Degrees to Radians, which is what COS expects [PRINT](PRINT.md) "The COSINE of the Angle is: "; C A = _ACOS(C) [PRINT](PRINT.md) "The ACOS of "; C; " is: "; A [PRINT](PRINT.md) "Notice, A is the Angle in Radians.  If we convert it to degrees, the value is "; [_R2D](_R2D.md)(A)  
```

``` Give me an Angle (in Degrees) =>Â ? 60  The COSINE of the Angle is:  .5000000000000001 The ACOS of  .5000000000000001  is:  1.047197551196598 Notice, A is the Angle in Radians.  If we convert it to degrees, we discover the value is  60  
```
