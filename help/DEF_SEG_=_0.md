#### SYNTAX

<blockquote>

`DEF SEG = 0 MONITOR INFORMATION ===============================`

</blockquote>

#### EXAMPLES

<blockquote>

```vb
A = INT(1193182 / F)
  H = INT(A / 256)
  L = A - H * 256
  OUT 66, L: OUT 66, H
```
  
```vb
DEF SEG = 0    ' set to PEEK and POKE TIMER
POKE (1132), 0 ' zero Timer ticks
DO
  key = INP(&H60)
LOOP UNTIL PEEK(1132) >= 1 ' until one tick (@ 1/18th sec.) has passed
DEF SEG
```
  


##### Example: DETERMINING THE DATE n DAYS FROM NOW.
```vb
A$ = DATE$: PRINT A$                'IMPORTANT! save original date!
 IF n <= 255 THEN POKE 1136, n
 IF n > 255 THEN
    FOR D = 1 TO n: POKE 1136, 1: NEXT D
 END IF
 laterdate$ = DATE$
 PRINT laterdate$                    'resulting date n days from today
 DATE$ = A$                          'restore original computer date!
```
  


##### Example: Determining the status of a drive motor:
```vb
IF PEEK(1087) AND 128 = 128 THEN PRINT "drive write in progress"
IF PEEK(1087) AND 15  = 0 THEN PRINT "No drive being written to"
```
  


##### Example: Drive$ designated is A, B, C or D, and the letter must be in uppercase.
```vb
IF PEEK(1087) AND 2 ^ (ASC (Drive$) - 65) THEN PRINT "Drive: " Drive$
```
  


##### Example: To turn on drive D for n seconds, where n is at MOST 14!Â :
```vb
POKE 1088, 18 + 2 * n
OUT 1010, 2 ^ (ASC("D") - 61) + ASC("D") - 53   '1010 = &H3F2
```
  


##### Example: The diskette parameter table consists of 11 bytes
```vb
DEF SEG = 0
D = PEEK(120) + 256 * PEEK(121) ' get value of Diskette

DEF SEG = PEEK(122) + 256 * PEEK(123) 'set to derive the following table
track = (PEEK(D) AND 240) \ 8 'time(milliseconds) required for diskette drive to move track to track
HUT = (PEEK(D) AND 15) * 32 ' head unload time(milliseconds) after read or write has occurred
HLT = (PEEK(D + 1) AND 240) \ 4 'head load time (in milliseconds)
DirMode = (PEEK(D + 1) AND 15) 'Direct Memory Access mode
WT = PEEK(D + 2) 'wait time until turning the motor off
BPS = PEEK(D + 3) 'number of bytes per sector on the disk. FOR v = 0 TO 3: 128 * 2 ^ v bytes per sector,
SPT = PEEK(D + 4) 'number of sectors per track, usually 8 or 9
GapLen = PEEK(D + 5) 'gap length (in bytes) between sectors
DatLen = PEEK(D + 6) 'data length read or written into a sector when sector length not specified
GFLen = PEEK(D + 7) 'gap length used when formatting
FVal = PEEK(D + 8) 'value format operation uses to initialize diskette sectors, usually 256
HST = PEEK(D + 9) 'number of milliseconds for the heads to stabilize
MST = PEEK(D + 10) 'number of eighths of a second for motor startup

```vb
Denote the initial port associated with COMn by Pn (Base).
       Normally, the value of P1 is 1016 and the value of P2 is 760.

```vb
Interrupt enabling:     Base + 1 address
      OUT Pn + 1, 1 enables an interrupt when a character has been received
      OUT Pn + 1, 2 enables an interrupt when a character has been transmitted
      OUT Pn + 1, 4 enables an interrupt when an error has occurred
      OUT Pn + 1, 8 enables an interrupt when the modem status has changed
```
  
```vb
sum of the associated numbers to port Pn + 1.
```
  
```vb
X = INP(Pn + 2).
      IntSet% = X AND 1       'has a value of 1 as long as no interrupts have been
                              'issued because of communications port activity.
```
  
```vb
IntHi% = X AND 6        'is used to identify the highest priority interrupt

```vb
Send: OUT Pn + 3, (d - 5) + (4 * (s - 1) + 8 * p).
```
  
```vb
H = INP(Pn + 3): OUT Pn + 3, H OR 128:
    OUT Pn, DL: OUT Pn + 1, DH: OUT Pn + 3, H.
```
  
```vb
Use values DL = 128 and DH = 1 for 300
    baud, and DL=96 and DH=0 for baud rate 1200.
```
  
```vb
Otherwise, DL = d MOD 256 and DH = d \ 256
    Where d is the divisor number given by the IBM Technical Reference manual
         in the table "Baud Rate at 1.853 MHz."
```
  
```vb
X = INP(Pn + 3)
    OUT Pn + 3, X OR 64:PLAY "MF":SOUND 32767,6: SOUND 32767,1: OUT Pn+3,X.
```
  
```vb
The PLAY and SOUND statements produce a delay of 1/3 second.
```
  
```vb
OUT Pn + 4, 1 to assert that the data terminal is ready (DTR)
     OUT Pn + 4, 2 to raise a request to send (RTS)
     OUT Pn + 4, 16 to perform loopback testing
```
  
```vb
To accomplish several of the above tasks simultaneously, OUT the sum of the
   associated numbers to port Pn + 4.
```
  
```vb
LET X = INP(Pn + 5). Now:
```
  
```vb
idle% = X AND 64  'has a value of 64 if the transmitter shift register is idle
    ready% = X AND 32 'is 32 if the transmitter holding register is ready to
                      'accept a character for transmission
    break% = X AND 16 'has the value 16 if the received data input is held in the
                      'spacing state too long (that is, if a break was received)
    nostop% = X AND 8 'has the value 8 if the received character did not have a

    overR% = X AND 2   'is 2 if the received data destroyed the previous character
                      '(an overrun error)
    RecRead% =  X AND 1 'has value 1 if a character is ready to be read from received
                        'buffer register

```vb
INP(Pn) will read the ASCII value of a character from the serial port,
```
  
```vb
IF (INP(Pn + 5) AND 1) = 1 THEN char$ = CHR$(INP(Pn))
```
  
```vb
read Base + 5 first:
     IF (INP(Pn + 5) AND 32) = 32 THEN
```
  
```vb
To determine the status of the modem, use Base + 6:
     X = INP(Pn + 6). Then:
       X AND 128 has the value 128 if a Carrier signal has been detected
       X AND 64 is 64 if the modem is ringing
       X AND 32 has a value of 32 if the modem has asserted Data Set Ready
       X AND 16 is 16 if the modem has asserted Clear to Send
       X AND 8 is 8 if the Carrier Detect has changed state
       X AND 4 has the value 4 if the Ring Indicator input has changed from On to Off
       X AND 2 is 2 if the Data Set Ready input has changed state since last read
       X AND 1 has a value of 1 if the Clear to Send input has changed since last read
