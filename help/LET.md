# LET

LET is a needless statement today. It was designed for the very early BASIC dialects to assign a value to a variable.

  

## Syntax

LET *variable* = *expression*
  

## Description

* LET a = 12 is the very same as a = 12, but wastes 4 extra bytes of program space.
* That said, LET is **optional**, it's the only keyword where the **entire keyword** is optional.ðŸ˜€
