## LET
---

### LET is a needless statement today. It was designed for the very early BASIC dialects to assign a value to a variable.

#### SYNTAX

`LET variable = expression`

#### DESCRIPTION
* [LET](./LET.md) a = 12 is the very same as a = 12 , but wastes 4 extra bytes of program space.
* That said, [LET](./LET.md) is optional , it's the only keyword where the entire keyword is optional.ðŸ˜€


#### SEE ALSO
* Variable
