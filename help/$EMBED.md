<blockquote>

### The $EMBED metacommand can embed any designated file (e.g. images, sounds, fonts and all other file types) into the compiled EXE file. You can roughly compare this to converting and placing a file's contents into DATA lines, but $EMBED obviously is much more convenient.

#### SYNTAX

<blockquote>

`$EMBED : ' filename ' , ' handle '`

#### PARAMETERS

#### DESCRIPTION

<blockquote>

*  All files will be embedded in a compressed form, if a 20% least ratio is reached.
	* This low ratio was chosen, cause it will be reached by most files, except those which are already highly compressed such as PNG, JPG, MP3/4, ZIP, 7z etc. and are not worth the additional effort for just a few bytes less.
*  To recall the embedded file data use the _EMBEDDED$ call with the very same handle identifier which was used in the respective file's $EMBED line. That call also does the decompression, if required.
*  Embedding files can be useful to deliver a program inclusive all required assets in just one EXE file.
*  No more worries whether a user installs your program correctly and retains the required folder structure.
*  If required, you can easily [WRITE](WRITE.md)  the files back to disk using the [_WRITEFILE](WRITEFILE.md)  command, i.e. you could create your own simple installer or package manager.
*  Embedded images, sounds or fonts can be passed directly to [_LOADIMAGE](LOADIMAGE.md)  , [_SNDOPEN](SNDOPEN.md)  or [_LOADFONT](LOADFONT.md)  respectively when using the memory load capabilities of these functions.
*  The $EMBED metacommand can be used everywhere in a program. You may even place it inside pre-compiler $IF .. $ELSE ... $END IF blocks and only the files designated in the true block are embedded then.
*  How many or how big files you can embed depends on your system achitecture (x86/x64) as well as your installed memory. However, it should work just fine for all the normally expected working cases like embedding a font, a spritesheet and some level graphics as well a couple sound effects.
*  To avoid useless bloat of the compiled EXE file, the embedding process is smart enough to only embed those files, which are recalled by the _EMBEDDED$ call at least once. I.e. you may $EMBED a dozen files, but if you recall only one of it in your program, then only that one file will be really embedded, while the other files are simply ignored.
