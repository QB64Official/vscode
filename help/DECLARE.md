## DECLARE
---

### In legacy versions such as QBasic / QuickBASIC the DECLARE keyword was used in the beginning of a program to declare the subroutines and functions used/defined in that program. Although this practice is still supported for compatibility with old code, it is no longer required in QB64, but instead it is used here to open a Library function block.

#### SYNTAX
