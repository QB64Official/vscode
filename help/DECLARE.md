# DECLARE

In legacy versions such as [QBasic](QBasic.md) / [QuickBASIC](QuickBASIC.md) the **DECLARE** keyword was used in the beginning of a program to declare the subroutines and functions used/defined in that program. Although this practice is still supported for compatibility with old code, it is no longer required in QB64, but instead it is used here to open a Library function block.

  

## Syntax
