* condition and condition2 can also contain their own [AND](./AND.md) evaluations.
* Both the [IF](./IF.md) evaluation and the [AND](./AND.md) evaluation must be true for the statement to be true.
* Statements can use parenthesis to clarify an evaluation.
* [AND](./AND.md) (boolean) and [OR](./OR.md) (boolean) cannot be used to combine command line operations.
* Not to be confused with the [AND](./AND.md) and [OR](./OR.md) numerical operations.
